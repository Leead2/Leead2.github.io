### CPSC 120
* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite because that was the first time I used the if, else command. This lab taught me how to use operators to see if the guess was greater than, less than, or equal to the secret number. It would repeat and this was the longest code I have written up to this date.
* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was another favorite lab I accomplished because I was sick this week. I had to figure out the lab by myself and it proved to be a challenge. However, I was able to understand vectors better and read each word throughout the vector. Also, I used the push back to print out words that were spelled incorrectly!
* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was a favorite because it was the first time we used classes. It was confusing at first, but with help from the professor and my peers, we finished within the lab time! The different classes made it easier for me to understand what it means to call a function. This lab included if, else statements which is something I enjoy doing!
